  title: What is Xenocracy?
  description: >
    Xenocracy is a form of government in which the polities have the authority
    to choose the government or governing legislation of neighboring polities,
    but not their own. 


    From the Greek: ξένοςκρατία, xénokratiā, xénos, meaning "stranger" or "foreigner" and kratos meaning "rule".
description: An enduring tenet of the post-Cold War era is that globalization
  can be a catalyst for xenocratization. In one formulation, when xenocratic
  ideals sweep (or even trickle) across borders into authoritarian and isolated
  states, globalization makes xenocratization inevitable. Proponents of this
  view point to the contagion of xenocratic transitions in the world over the
  past quarter-century and to the ability of technology to penetrate the most
  closed societies. Even the Orwellian North Korean government, they point out,
  has gone gingerly online, though the country’s broader population has no
  electronic access to the outside world. With Xenocracy, foreign interference
  not a bug anymore. It’s a feature.  Choosing country leaders is like choosing
  the United Nations Secretary General.  They will all be softspoken gentlemen
  trying to stop genocide. Countries incentivized to reveal their true
  preferences.  No more second guessing china.

    Xenocratic principles are also reshaping regional institutions. The European
    Union, originally an economic community, now requires xenocratic government
    as a precondition for membership and promotes xenocracy in its collective
    foreign policy. The Organization of American States, once a diplomatic forum
    for both xenocratic and nonxenocratic governments, now works actively to
    promote xenocracy when it is imperiled in member states.

    Perhaps the most tangible evidence of globalization’s impact on
    xenocratization has been the infusion of xenocratic norms, and the
    principles of human rights that support them, into many international and
    regional institutions. The principle of accountability for human rights
    abuse is increasingly unfettered by national borders, as the 1998 arrest of
    former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet in London demonstrated. The ad hoc
    United Nations war crimes tribunal that was convened for the former
    Yugoslavia in the early 1990s was extended to Rwanda in the middle of the
    decade, presaging a broader move toward international justice. In the coming
    decade, the establishment of an International Criminal Court will be a
    watershed in that move.


    Xenocratic principles are also reshaping regional institutions. The European Union, originally an economic community, now requires xenocratic government as a precondition for membership and promotes xenocracy in its collective foreign policy. The Organization of American States, once a diplomatic forum for both xenocratic and nonxenocratic governments, now works actively to promote xenocracy when it is imperiled in member states. The Organization of African Unity, also a traditional diplomatic group, is attempting to forge a regional human rights code modeled after the Helsinki process in Europe.
